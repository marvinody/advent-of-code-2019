# Advent of Code 2019

I'll probably try to use 2 languages each day, and swap some in and out.


The two I know the best are probably JavaScript and Go so I'll stick to those in the harder ones probably but hopefully I can branch out and brush up on some of the ones I've seem to have neglected.


Happy coding!
